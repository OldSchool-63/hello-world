On GitHub, saved changes are called _commits_. 
Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.

When you’re satisfied that these are the changes you want to submit, click the big green *Create Pull Request* button.
